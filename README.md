Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.



Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with manipulations of software applications by using programming languages to provide solutions to end user.

Importance of software engineering in the technology industry.
1. With the improvement and advancement of technology, software engineering airs out and create awareness of what has changed in the new versions or the updated programming languages. 
2. It's also useful in companies, institutions and organisations in providing solutions to its members, employers or employees since most if not all sectors nowadays are computerized.
3. Through software engineering, an organisation can easily arrange its operations.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

i). 1948: The first compiler which translates human-readable code into machine code ws developed by Grace Brewster Murray Hopper who was a computer pioneer and naval officer.

ii). 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

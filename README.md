#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with manipulations of software applications by using programming languages to provide solutions to end user.

Importance of software engineering in the technology industry.
1. With the improvement and advancement of technology, software engineering airs out and create awareness of what has changed in the new versions or the updated programming languages. 
2. It's also useful in companies, institutions and organisations in providing solutions to its members, employers or employees since most if not all sectors nowadays are computerized.
3. Through software engineering, an organisation can easily arrange its operations.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

i). 1948: The first compiler which translates human-readable code into machine code ws developed by Grace Brewster Murray Hopper who was a computer pioneer and naval officer.

ii). 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Phase 1: Planning; Involves defining the software's purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route.

Phase 2: Requirements analysis; Seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users.

Phase 3: Design; Its all about building the framework.

Phase 4: Coding; It is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Phase 5: Testing; A stringent quality inspection on a production line (i.e when vulnerabilities are uncovered).

Phase 6: Deployment; Involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end-users.

Phase 7: Maintenance; Characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software's best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.

Distinguish betweeen Waterfall and Agile methodologies.

Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving on to the next step. The phases include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams. When implementing an agile model, requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and adaptation to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer:
1. Understanding their clients' requirements and specifications.
2. Writing code to develop the application, creating prototypes, testing the app before it's launched and debugging the app as errors are encountered.

A quality assurance engineer:
1. Preventing issues.
2. Creating test plans.
3. Executing tests.
4. Identifying and reporting issues.
5. Managing bugs.
6. Automating tests.
7. Continuously improving the testing process.
8. Get relevant education.

A project manager:
1. Planning Everything from Execution to Delivery.
2. Oversee the Software Development Team.
3. Delegating Work Effectively.
4. Monitoring Progress and Tracking Roadblocks.
5. Managing the Deployment Deliverables.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
They are software applications that help programmers develop software codes efficiently. The increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.

Version Control Systems.
They facilitate coordination, sharing, and collaboration across the entire software development team. They enables teams to work in distributed and asynchronous environments, manage changes and versions of code and artifacts, and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common challenges:
1. Writing codes constantly expand databases.
2. Requirement of certain level of consistent enthusiasm.
3. A lot of research needed.
4. Requires much trying and experimenting.
5. Limited infrastructure.
6. Growing customer and client demands.

Strategies to overcome the challenges:
1. Apply a strict routine.
2. Use task manager to keep track of the projects and jobs.
3. Ensure to maintain healthy habits.
4. Develop a disaster recovery plan in case of an emergency.
5. Emphasise reliablity.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing: Involves testing individual components or units of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system.

Intergration testing: Individual units or modules are combined and tested together to identify any issues with their interactions.

System testing: Evaluates the complete and fully integrated software product to ensure compliance with specified requirements.

Acceptance testing: Real users test the software to ensure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios and meets their expectations. 

Importance of testing in software quality assurance.
1. Risk Mitigation – Testing helps identify defects and failures early in the development process when they are less expensive to fix. This reduces project risks related to quality, security, performance, etc.
2. Confidence – Executing a well–planned software test strategy provides confidence that the software works as intended before its release.
3. Compliance – Testing can ensure that software adheres to standards, regulations, and compliance requirements. This is especially critical for safety–critical systems.
4. User Satisfaction – Rigorous testing from a user perspective can verify usability, functionality, and compatibility. This increases customer/user satisfaction and reduces negative impacts to an organization’s reputation or finances from poor quality products.
5. Optimization – Testing provides vital feedback that can be used to continuously improve software quality, user experience, security, performance and other product attributes.
6. Cost Savings – Investing in testing activities reduces downstream costs related to defects found post–release. It is much cheaper to find and fix bugs earlier in the development cycle.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs for AI tools that will produce optimal outputs.

Importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models.

The rapidly emerging role in the AI ecosystem transforms how we interact with and develop AI systems. Its criticality is bridging the gap between raw AI capabilities and real-world applications.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt example is "What is the role of scientific studying living organisms". Hence the improved prompt of this vague prompt is "Give the importance of biology".
